Small training tasks during my intern months

# Contents
1. Colorful carousel (ColorfulCarousel.html) - A carousel of (Sesame street) letters with a spinning animation. It is pretty addictive going round and round and round and round... and round.
2. Custom console (CustomConsole.html, CustomConsole.js) - Works like the normal console, but only on really lowere level. Don't judge it was 2013 back then.
3. DateTimePicker - (DateTimePicker.html) - A small and basic picker for selecting date and time. Go ahead, try it. I dare you!
4. Globalisation UI (Globalisation UI.html) - An user interface for sorting languages and defining their order. It uses jQuery sortable.
5. Ranking (Ranking.html) - An user interface that allows the user to rank diferent brands. Google+ of course, which is your top brand?
6. Swipe gallery (SwipeGallery.html) - A test for creating an Android-like apps folder gallery. it is just a test, didn't had to work.
7. Theme generator (ThemeGenerator.html, ThemeGenerator.js) - An interface for customizing UI elements. There is magic at play here, be careful!
8. Converter 1 - (Translate.html) - Sometimes i start to write Bulgarian with English letters and to skip the rewriting I made a converter to do it for me. It is so easier now!
9. Converter 2 (strObjStr.js) - Oh yes, almost forgot about this one. A conferter from string to object and object to string.
